# Dashly

## Summary

Dashly (the "**THEME**") was created by Webinning (see https://themes.getbootstrap.com/store/webinning/).

This specific version of the **THEME** has been slightly changed by us in order to fit the needs for this project and its source code is NOT AVAILABLE ON THIS REPOSITORY as that would go against the terms of our current licensing agreement.

If you need it, please know you can purchase this theme from Bootstrap Themes at https://themes.getbootstrap.com/product/dashly-admin-dashboard-template/.

We're using Dashly/1.5.0.

## License

### Basics

The **STANDARD LICENSE** grants you a non-exclusive right to make use of **THEME** you have purchased.

You are licensed to use the **THEME** to create one **END PRODUCT** for yourself or for one client (a “single application”), and the **END PRODUCT** can be distributed for Free.

You can:

* Create one **END PRODUCT** for a client, transfer that **END PRODUCT** to your client, charge them for your services. The license is then transferred to the client;

* Make unlimited copies of the single **END PRODUCT** as long as the **END PRODUCT** is distributed for free;

* Modify the **THEME** or combine the **THEME** with other works to make a derivative one. The result is subject to this license. This clause applies to extracting single components from the **THEME** and using it in derivative works as well.

You must not:

* Sell the **END PRODUCT** except to one client;

* Re-distribute the **THEME**’s source, modified or not, even if the **THEME** is modified;

* Use the **THEME** in any application allowing an **END USER** to customize the **THEME**, like "build it yourself" or "**THEME** generators";

* Allow the **END USER** of the **END PRODUCT** to access the **THEME**’s source and use it separately from the **END PRODUCT**;

If a **THEME** contains code, images, or content sourced from elsewhere under a different license, that item retains its original license. The license for the code, images, or content will be noted by the **THEME** author. You are responsible for adhering to the original license or clearing it with the author of the code, image, or content.

This license can be terminated if you breach it and you lose the right to distribute the **END PRODUCT** until the **THEME** has been fully removed from the **END PRODUCT**.

The author of the **THEME** retains ownership of the **THEME**, but grants you the license on these terms. This license is between the author of the **THEME** and you. Be Colossal LLC (Bootstrap Themes) are not a party to this license or the one granting you the license.
